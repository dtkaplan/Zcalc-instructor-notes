## Introduction

- A new calculus core at USAFA

    + Core required of all cadets: Calc I/II
        - There's a third core "math" course not in the perview of this project: Statistics

    + New:  
        - Enhance student engagement to increase number of students majoring in STEM disciplines.
        - Faculty discontent with traditional course: Why are we teaching this stuff?
      
- This talk contains my views, as a private citizen, and doesn't necessarily reflect any official view of the USAFA.


## Timeline

+ circa 2017: USAFA determined to replace Calc I/II 
    - USAFA identified Macalester's "Applied Multivariate Calculus I" as a model, a course I developed in 2003-2012


+ late 2018: I was recruited to lead the curricular development.
    - Increase connections to statistics and data science.
    - Increase connections to physics and engineering.
    - Add a meaningful computational component.
    
+ July 2020: Project started

+ August 2020: Prototype course commenced. 
    - 3 faculty teaching 150 cadets.
    - Initial textbook Kilty and McAllister, *Mathematical Modeling and Applied Calculus*
    
+ August 2021: Phased expansion
    - 12 faculty teaching 400 cadets
    - Home grown textbook: *MOSAIC Calculus*

+ August 2022: Anticipated full deployment: 
    - approximately 25 faculty and 800 cadets

## Goals for USAFA Calculus

- Provide a useful introduction to 

    - The use and analysis of multivariate functions and multi-dimensional space.

    - Develop basic competencies in the mathematics and phenomena of dynamical systems, e.g. behavior and analysis of ordinary differential equations.

    - Lay the foundations for building and understanding models based on data. 
        - Not including statistical inference. 2022-2023 project will be about statistics. I would like to tie it closely to the calculus core, but that's just my view.
    
- Be accessible and meaningful to students who haven't studied calculus previously.

- Fit into 6 credit hours over two semesters.

## The elephant in the room

1. Many students don't succeed with differential or integral calculus.
2. Because they don't succeed in the introductory phases, they traditionally don't reach the more "advanced" topics we set as our goals. (Previous slide.) 
    - Very few fields outside of engineering, physics, and engineering have any requirements in these advanced topics.
    - Traditionally, intro- or mid-level stats does not either. But is this sustainable in an era of data-science and machine learning? 

## Review: Some ways to deal with low success rates

1. Change the goal: Don't require calculus. Substitute statistics instead.
    i. A solid idea for students in health sciences, where the calculus had no genuine connections to the downstream courses.
2. Divide students by aptitude. 
    i. Remediation such as pre-calculus or "college algebra."
        - Poor record of leading to success.
    ii. Streamlined courses such as "business calculus."
        - "Business calculus" doesn't reach the topics we're interested in here.
    iii. Place high-aptitude students into advanced courses.
        - Doesn't address the core problem of low success rates.
    
USAFA has a "core course" philosophy, so these approaches don't apply.

## A third way

This is a metaphor.

> *The "Third Way" is used to refer to a set of political beliefs and principles that is neither extremely right-wing nor extremely left-wing.* --- Collins Dictionary

> *Third way, in politics, a proposed alternative between two hitherto dominant models, namely left-wing and right-wing political groups.* --- Encyclopaedia Britannica

> *A political movement in which the development of business* [substitute: "skills for downstream study"] *is balanced with the needs of society* [substitute: "accessibility to students].* --- Cambridge English dictionary




## A third way?

Note the ***?***

We have almost 20 years of experience with this approach at Macalester College:

- Initially, a "terminal" course, *Applied Calculus* to support students whose major requires "a single semester" of calculus.
    i. Unexpectedly turned into a gateway to advanced study for students who never knew there were genuine **applications** of math. This doubled the number of math majors and led to new majors in *Applied Math and Statistics* and, recently, *Data Science*.
        - The doubling occurred < 2010. Since then, enrollment has continued to soar, but this is due to external factors. Math/Applied/Stat/Data-Science majors are now about 10% of all graduates.
- Now is the first of a three-course sequence: *Applied Multivariate Calculus I/II/III*
- About half of all students take one or more of the courses.

**But only half**. A sort of self-selected tracking so not representative of the situations in a core course.

- Finishing two years experience at USAFA, 500+ students. But little data yet on downstream success. 

## Our third way



## This presentation

- First time I've talked about this project outside USAFA.

- Due to COVID and simultaneous development and deployment, there was never a chance properly to plan and stage the course.
    - Only one senior USAFA faculty involved in first year (+ two captains)
    - USAFA gave me practically a *tabula rasa*

- I'd like to talk with you about the design of the course, choices made, and choices that might have been made instead.
    - The format as an all-students-in core was a given.
    
## Aside: Consequences of a core

- All cadets take the same course.
    - Exceptions for students who place out and want to start in Calc III.
    
- About 2/3 of students in first semester had some high-school exposure to calculus. 

- Major challenge: Remain accessible to all students while still engaging to students who have seen calculus.

    
## A broader opportunity?

It's not often that someone is given the chance and resources to develop a new calculus course from scratch.

+ I determined to take advantage and try to produce sufficient materials and support for the course to be picked up by other institutions.
    - Two years time *without teaching duties* to work on the project.
    - USAFA instructors who needed to learn the approach and material with hardly any advance preparation.

## A calculus construction kit

Design philosophy: Future users of the course should be able to design their own courses, adding new components as suits their environment:

Examples:

- A proof based component about limits
- Components closely tied to specific engineering fields, biology, etc.
- A modeling practicum

The course should be modular.

## Analogy: Modular housing

Many different modular housing systems are on the market. 

They provide a set of components that can be put together to suit the homeowner's needs and tastes.

You cannot readily mix and match different companies' systems.

- Size of a unit:
    - fraction of a wall
    - complete wall
    - complete envelope
    
- Wiring and plumbing
    - pre-integrated in wall or floor
    - channels for custom installation
    
- Does it require professional assembly?

- Site/foundation requirements.
    

## A calculus "API"

Components I could plausibly define:

1. A minimum set of **algebra skills** needed for success in the course.

- straight lines, slopes and y-intercept
- recognize roots of a quadratic polynomial
- simple exponent manipulation, distinguish between $x^n$ and $n^x$
- recognize functional notation, functions with one, two, ... inputs.

2. A minimum set of **notation** that needs to be assimilated.

3. **Computing framework** to provide a non-algebra means to work with calculus concepts.

4. Small set of graphics and graphics skills.

Components are needed for a comprehensive solution but that I could not define on my own:

- Course support software, including homework systems.

- Interactive graphics system for developing concepts. 

## Notation

Principles:
i. By looking at a bit of notation, you should be able to say what kind of thing it refers to.
i. Strive to have one way of saying something and to be consistent.
i. Notation for all functions should support functions of multiple inputs.
i. Make **definition** explicit.
i. Strive to be compatible with computer notation and parallel it if possible. Example: hardly any computer language will let you name something `f'` or `df/dx`.
i. Avoid ambiguous terms, even if they are traditional.

Functions: A name followed by a parenthesis. So $\sin(x)$ not $\sin x$. Can use $\sin()$ to name the function.
    - exception: exponentials are often written with superscripts rather than parentheses: $e^{kt}$, $x^n$.

Function inputs: From back of alphabet: u, v, w, x, y, z.  (These are *inputs*, not "variables." Let's leave "variables" for statistics.)

Function evaluation: $f(t=3)$

Function definition: 
    - $f(x) \equiv x e^{kx}$
    - `f <- makeFun(x * exp(k*x) ~ x)`
    - NEVER $y = 2 x^2$ 

Parameters: Following tradition, e.g. $k$, $P$, $A$, $\omega$, 

Coefficients: Mostly from front of alphabet. Numerical subscripts. 

Specific values of inputs: e.g. 
    - $x_0$
    - $x^\star$ for argmax. But maybe I shouldn't allow superscripts.

Vectors and matrices are decorated with harpoons: $\stackrel{\rightharpoonup}{\mathbf u}$ and $\stackrel{\leftrightharpoons}{\mathbf A}$.

Derivatives: 
  - $\partial_t f(t)$. 
  - `dt_f`

## Small set of core functions

"Pattern-book functions" don't have parameters but do have English names. All have a single input.

- $\text{one}()$
- $\text{identity}()$
- $\text{recip}()$
- Exponential: $e^x$
- Power-law: $x^p$
- Logarithm: $\ln()$
- Sinusoid: $\sin()$ 
- Gaussian: $\text{dnorm}()$
- Sigmoid: $\text{pnorm}()$

"Basic modeling functions" have parameters, e.g.

- $\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{P} t\right)$
- $\text{dnorm}(x, \text{mean}, \text{sd})$
- $e^{kt}$

Students should be able to sketch the pattern-book functions on demand, identify gaps in domain (e.g. $\ln()$ and $\text{recip}()$) and horizontal and vertical asymptotes.

Must also know derivative and anti-derivative of every pattern-book and basic-modeling function.


## Graphics

- Graph of function of one input
- Contour plot for functions with two inputs
- Vector field
- Path 
- Inequality constraint
- Point plot for data


## Quantities vs numbers

The inputs to basic modeling functions are ***quantities*** and have a dimension and units. The outputs are also quantities.

Functions created by differentiation or anti-differentiation (typically) have different output dimension.

## Linear algebra

Directed at two settings:

1. Least squares modeling: $A \vec{x} \approx b$, find $x$ that makes the approximation the best possible.
2. Eigenvalues/vectors (in dynamics)

Matrices are collections of (column) vectors. A matrix times a vector is a linear combination of the column vectors.

High level operations and concepts: 
- projection of a vector onto a subspace
- decomposition into projection and residual
- solving for $\vec{x}$ 
- Conversion of $A$ into $Q$.

Topics that are ignored:

- determinants: not on topic
- inverses/singular matrices: not needed  

## Dynamics




**Title**

Remodeling the mathematics core at the Air Force Academy

**Abstract**

USAFA has had a two-semester core calculus course for about 60 years. Based on a traditional Calc I/II sequence, it has changed incrementally over the years. Several years ago, USAFA determined that incremental change is insufficient and that a new core course should be developed from scratch. The new course is oriented around modeling and computation and includes topics not usually seen in Calc I/II such as dimensional analysis, linear algebra, and dynamics.

USAFA does not have tracks in its core curriculum, so the new course has to be accessible to all cadets, regardless of math background, aptitude, or intended major. In this talk, I'll briefly outline the course, focusing mainly on how the course can be accessible while being engaging and meaningful for students who have had previous calculus and who are heading toward STEM majors.

A draft textbook for the course, "MOSAIC Calculus," is available freely online at mosaic-web.org/MOSAIC-Calculus/
