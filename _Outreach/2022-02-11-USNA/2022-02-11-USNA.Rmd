## Introduction

- A new calculus core at USAFA

    + Core required of all cadets: Calc I/II

    + New:  
        - Enhance student engagement to increase number of students majoring in STEM disciplines.
        - Faculty discontent: Why are we teaching this stuff?
      

## Timeline

+ circa 2017: USAFA determined to replace Calc I/II 
    - USAFA identified Macalester's "Applied Multivariate Calculus I" as a model, a course I developed in 2003-2012


+ late 2018: I was recruited to lead the curricular development.
    - Increase connections to statistics and data science.
    - Increase connections to physics and engineering.
    - Add a meaningful computational component.
    
+ July 2020: Project started

+ August 2020: Prototype course commenced. 
    - 3 faculty teaching 150 cadets.
    - Initial textbook Kilty and McAllister, *Mathematical Modeling and Applied Calculus*
    
+ August 2021: Phased expansion
    - 12 faculty teaching 400 cadets
    - Home grown textbook: *MOSAIC Calculus*

+ August 2022: Anticipated full deployment: 
    - approximately 25 faculty and 800 cadets

## This presentation

- First time I've talked about this project outside USAFA.

- Due to COVID and simultaneous development and deployment, there was never a chance properly to plan and stage the course.
    - Only one senior USAFA faculty involved in first year (+ two captains)
    - USAFA gave me practically a *tabula rasa*

- I'd like to talk with you about the design of the course, choices made, and choices that might have been made instead.
    - The format as an all-students-in core was a given.
    
## Aside: Consequences of a core

- All cadets take the same course.
    - Exceptions for students who place out and want to start in Calc III.
    
- About 2/3 of students in first semester had some high-school exposure to calculus. 

- Major challenge: Remain accessible to all students while still engaging to students who have seen calculus.

    
## A broader opportunity?

It's not often that someone is given the chance and resources to develop a new calculus course from scratch.

+ I determined to take advantage and try to produce sufficient materials and support for the course to be picked up by other institutions.
    - Two years time *without teaching duties* to work on the project.
    - USAFA instructors who needed to learn the approach and material with hardly any advance preparation.

## A calculus construction kit

Design philosophy: Future users of the course should be able to design their own courses, adding new components as suits their environment:

Examples:

- A proof based component about limits
- Components closely tied to specific engineering fields, biology, etc.
- A modeling practicum

The course should be modular.

## Analogy: Modular housing

Many different modular housing systems are on the market. 

They provide a set of components that can be put together to suit the homeowner's needs and tastes.

You cannot readily mix and match different companies' systems.

- Size of a unit:
    - fraction of a wall
    - complete wall
    - complete envelope
    
- Wiring and plumbing
    - pre-integrated in wall or floor
    - channels for custom installation
    
- Does it require professional assembly?

- Site/foundation requirements.
    

## A calculus "API"

Components I could plausibly define:

1. A minimum set of **algebra skills** needed for success in the course.

- straight lines, slopes and y-intercept
- recognize roots of a quadratic polynomial
- simple exponent manipulation, distinguish between $x^n$ and $n^x$


2. A minimum set of **notation** that needs to be assimilated.

3. **Computing framework** to provide a non-algebra means to work with calculus concepts.

Components are needed for a comprehensive solution but that I could not define on my own:

- Course support software, including homework systems.

- Interactive graphics system for developing concepts.

**Title**

Remodeling the mathematics core at the Air Force Academy

**Abstract**

USAFA has had a two-semester core calculus course for about 60 years. Based on a traditional Calc I/II sequence, it has changed incrementally over the years. Several years ago, USAFA determined that incremental change is insufficient and that a new core course should be developed from scratch. The new course is oriented around modeling and computation and includes topics not usually seen in Calc I/II such as dimensional analysis, linear algebra, and dynamics.

USAFA does not have tracks in its core curriculum, so the new course has to be accessible to all cadets, regardless of math background, aptitude, or intended major. In this talk, I'll briefly outline the course, focusing mainly on how the course can be accessible while being engaging and meaningful for students who have had previous calculus and who are heading toward STEM majors.

A draft textbook for the course, "MOSAIC Calculus," is available freely online at mosaic-web.org/MOSAIC-Calculus/

**Bio**

Danny Kaplan is distinguished visiting professor at USAFA, where for two years he has worked on the new calculus core. He is Professor Emeritus of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science at Macalester College, where he introduced new curricula in calculus, scientific computing, applied math, and statistics. He has written textbooks on a variety of topics: nonlinear dynamics, scientific programming, statistical modeling, and data science. (His statistical modeling book was used briefly at USNA.) He received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Consortium for the Advancement of Undergraduate Statistics Education. His doctorate is in biomedical engineering from Harvard University. He also holds a master's degree in Engineering-Economy Systems from Stanford.
