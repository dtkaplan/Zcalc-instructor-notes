That document, when compiled to HTML, will not generate a listing of blog entries. Instead, it is an ordinary {distill} Rmd file with links to the various blog directories.\nThose blog directories are _Block-1, _Block-2, …, _Block-6, _Manifestations, and _Instructions. When creating a new posting, be sure to place it in the correct directory. For instance, to create a new posting relevant to Block-5 of the course, create the skeleton of the post this way:\n\n\n\nThe second argument is the directive to put the new post on the Block-5 page.\nAlong with the various _Block-{n} directories in the top level of the repo, there are files named Block-1.Rmd, Block-2.Rmd, and so on. These appear to have no content, but actually the content will be created when the website is built. After being built, each of those documents becomes a listing of the posts in the corresponding _Block-{n} directory. You should not need to edit the Block-{n}.Rmd files.\n\n\n\n",
