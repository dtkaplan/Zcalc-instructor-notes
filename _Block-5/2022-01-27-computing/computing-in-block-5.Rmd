```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

Describe `%dot%`, `%onto%`, and `%perp%`.


It's possible to use `cbind()` and `rbind()` in the reverse order than we do in the text, so that the construction statement looks like the matrix itself.

```{r}
rbind(
    cbind(1, 10),
    cbind(2, 11),
    cbind(3, 12)
)
```

This is well suited to presenting the matrix as it will appear. We don't do this because we want to emphasize that a matrix is a collection of vectors, and we use only column vectors in the text.
