The instructor can easily see that the Block-5 chapters are about linear algebra. But the word "algebra" is missing in the title of the block. Instead, the title is *Linear Combinations*. In part, this is intended to help unify the text, since linear combinations appear in all of the first 4 Blocks. But also the title was selected because the canonical topics found in just about any linear algebra book are not included---for good reason.

- matrices as rectangular arrays of numbers
- determinant
- gaussian elimination
- null space

The approach



## The software

`rbind()`, `cbind()`, `%dot%` and so on.
